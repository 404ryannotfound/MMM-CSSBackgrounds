# Module: MMM-CSSBackgrounds

Pure animated CSS backgrounds for use with Magic Mirror 2 on a Raspberry Pi.
 
The MMM-CSSBackgrounds module allows you to display an animation in the background. All animations are CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) based with no dependencies on Javascript frameworks.

## Dependencies / Requirements
This module requires no special dependencies, however, it was tested using the Raspberry Pi 4 2GG. Performance cannot be guaranteed on older devices with less memory.

## Operation
This module simply adds CSS classes to the Magic Mirror `index.html` template, and uses minimal markup to create the animated backgrounds.

## Installation

To install, cd into the `modules` directory, clone, cd into the newly created `MMM-CSSBackgrounds` directory, then install.
```
cd MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/404ryannotfound/MMM-CSSBackgrounds.git
cd MMM-CSSBackgrounds
npm install
```
Alternatively:

Download the zip file https://github.com/404ryannotfound/MMM-CSSBackgrounds/archive/master.zip. Unzip the contents into the modules directory of your Magic Mirror install. Rename the '```MMM-CSSBackgrounds-master```' folder to '```MMM-CSSBackgrounds```'.

## Loading the module
Once downloaded, add the module to the modules array in the ```config/config.js``` file:

### Example:
```
modules: [
   {
   module: "MMM-CSSBackgrounds", 
   position: "fullscreen_below",
   config: {
	theme: "animatedgradient"       
	/* Choose from: particles, firefly, risingparticles animatedgradient, animatedbgcolor, slidingdiagonal, lavalamp, bokeh, bokehgrey, risingcubes, tritravelers, bubbles, bubblescoloredbg, beer, snowflakes, blobs */

  }   
 }, 
];
```
## CSS Modifications

To assist with accessibuility & readability, All fonts and screen items have been set to #ffffff (white) in the CSS.
If you wish to modify, simply edit the ```MMM-CSSBackgrounds.css file```. You can also modify the ```html``` color also, if you wish to change the background from a blue circular gradient to black.

**Lavalamp** color can also be changed in the CSS, with sample colors given. (These may be configurable via config.js moving forward).

## Issues known/contributing

Log any issues to the [Issues](https://github.com/404ryannotfound/MMM-CSSBackgrounds/issues) page.

### Known issues/Limitations

Whilst care has been taken to avoid excessive animation that would degrade the Pi's performance, please test and monitor your usage of this module. **Lavalamp** in particular seems slightly intensive on the rendering, so please take care if you Pi is prone to overheating.
